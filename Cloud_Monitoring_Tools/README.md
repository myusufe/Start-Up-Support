## CLoud Monitoring Tools

1. **[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)**
<br>Prometheus is an open-source cloud-native monitoring solution primarily fixated on data gathering and analysis based on time-series data. It enables users to set up monitoring capabilities by utilizing the in-built toolset.

<br>It is an ideal monitoring setup for containerized environments like kubernetes and the best open-source server monitoring tool.
It is able to assemble several metrics on servers, kubernetes, and various devices using SNMP pings and inspect network bandwidth usage from the device point of view, along with the other functions. The PromQL system analyzes data and permits the program to produce plots, tables, and other graphics on the systems it monitors.

<br>The alert manager is another component of Prometheus. It handles alerting for all alerting rules configured in Prometheus.

<br>Prometheus can collect system metrics, application metrics, and metrics from modern containerized applications. Also, it has very good integration with tools like Grafana for visualizing metrics. Grafana is one of the best open-source monitoring dashboards.
