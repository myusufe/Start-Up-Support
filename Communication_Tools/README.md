# Communication Tools 

1. **[Slack](https://slack.com/)**
<br>Every business owner knows that communication is key to operating a successful business. With Slack, communicating within your team is quick, easy, and intuitive. Unlike communicating through email, users use instant messaging to chat with individual team members, public channels, and organized private groups. Additionally, you can add an unlimited number of members to keep communication strong as your startup grows. 

&emsp;&emsp;Pricing: Free - $12.50/user/month

2. **[Ooma](https://www.ooma.com/)**
<br>Ooma offers business phone support with big-business features but on a small-business budget. Once set up, the service comes with a virtual receptionist, extension dialing, call conferencing, holding music, and in-field calls for employees who travel. Although the setup is DIY in order to keep costs low, a guide makes it easy enough to set up your business’s phones in just a few minutes.

&emsp;&emsp;Pricing: $14.95–$24.95/user/month

3. **[Phone.com](https://www.phone.com/)**
<br>Phone.com has customizable business phone services, so you can keep costs low by only paying for what each employee actually needs. Whereas other phone services sign each employee up at the same plan level, Phone.com lets you individually sign each user up for the Basic, Plus, or Pro Plan. You’ll probably want the pro plan’s call recording, voicemail transcription, call analytics, and CRM integration. Employees who work part-time might only need the Basic’s 500 minutes per month.

&emsp;&emsp;Pricing: $11.99–$23.99/user/month

4. **[RingCentral](https://www.ringcentral.com/)**
<br>RingCentral brings employees and customers alike together through robust communication capabilities. Even the most basic plan supports up to 20 users — enough for many small businesses — and toll-free phone numbers. The higher plans support 200-participant video meetings, advanced call handling, real-time analytics, and device status updates, and integrations with Salesforce, Zendesk, and industry-specific software. This is a truly comprehensive phone service for businesses that want extensive call data.

&emsp;&emsp;Pricing: $14.99–$37.49/user/month

5. **[Google Meet]()**
<br>Google Meet (formerly hangout meets) is a smart video conferencing software for businesses globally. As Google Meet and Google Workspace are fully connected, you get the flexibility to attend meetings right from a Calendar event or email invitation. If you’re joining from a laptop, phone, or conference room, all the crucial event information is there when you need it.

&emsp;&emsp;Pricing:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Google Meet Free
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Google Workspace Individual: $7.99/month
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- Google Workspace Enterprise: As this is a custom plan, you need to contact the support staff to get the quotation.


5. **[Zoom](https://zoom.us)**
<br>Similar to Google Meet, Zoom is a video conferencing platform. Group meetings are limited to 40 minutes with the free plan, but one-on-one video calls can be as long as you like. They offer optional add-ons, such as hosting webinars, as well as subscription packages with more features like the ability to record the meet.
Participants don’t have to create an account in order to join a Zoom meeting, but hosts do need one to create meetings and send out invitations.
