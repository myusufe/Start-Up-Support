## Make LLC Company

1. **[Northwest Registered Agent](https://www.northwestregisteredagent.com/)**
<br>Northwest Registered Agent is our top choice for the best LLC service. As you may have guessed by its company name, the platform offers premium registered agent services; in fact, you'll receive a full year of included registered agent service if you start an LLC with Northwest.
<br>Not only does Northwest make forming your business online quick and simple, but it also offers exceptional, knowledgeable customer service. Customers can get support from a team of Corporate Guides — business experts who help you throughout the entire LLC formation process.
<br>For only $29 + state fee, you’ll receive the following and more:
<br>- One full year of free registered agent service
<br>- Industry-leading customer support
<br>- Free mail forwarding
<br>- Quick and user-friendly ordering process
<br>- Free phone service for 60 days
<br>- Online account to access important business documents
<br>- Plenty of experience, but still a small enough company to provide a personal touch
<br>Overall, we highly recommend Northwest due to its excellent customer service and affordability.

2. **[ZenBusiness](https://share.zenbusiness.com/myusufe)**
<br>ZenBusiness is a small business formation service dedicated to helping others launch their ventures. The platform was founded in 2015 by a team of entrepreneurs who experienced the barriers that others continue to face today when starting a business.
<br>ZenBusiness is a good option to start your company online for the following reasons:
<br>- Knowledgeable and responsive customer support
<br>- Positive customer feedback from ZenBusiness reviews online
<br>- Online user dashboard with personal ZenBusiness login
<br>Below are some of the business formation services ZenBusiness provides in its basic package:
<br>Business formation (LLC, partnership, corporation)
<br>- Unlimited name availability searches
<br>- Free accounting consultation
<br>- Free automatic expense tracking
<br>- Free tax deduction tagging
<br>- Worry-Free Compliance free for the first year: Includes annual filing report alerts and submittal, two free filing changes per year, and insurance on document filings to maintain good standing if documents are not submitted on time.

3. **[Tailor Brands](https://www.tailorbrands.com/)**
<br>If you are ready to launch your business online, the Tailor Brands Elite Plan is one of the best premium, all-in-one packages we have found. It goes beyond the basics of LLC formation to provide powerful branding tools. With just a few clicks, you can form your LLC, set up a website, and begin your social media marketing efforts.

4. **[Incfile](https://www.incfile.com/)**
<br>Incfile is among the best LLC services out there. We’ve worked with them multiple times ourselves, and highly recommend their formation services. It’s impressive how much you get for only the state filing fee:
<br>- 1 free Year Registered Agent Service
<br>- Real-time Order Tracking & Free Shipping
<br>- Online Dashboard of Compliance Tools
<br><br>Incfile's LLC formation services are similar to those of ZenBusiness (e.g. Operating Agreement, EIN, registered agent services, etc).
<br>Customers also rave about the support they receive from Incfile’s reps after starting a company, which is another one of the many reasons they’re a top-rated LLC service.

5. **[LegalZoom](https://www.legalzoom.com/)**
<br>LegalZoom is the most well-known and used business formation service available, with about 4 million customers served since they opened their doors in 1999. Their basic package includes:
<br>- All formation documents filed with the state
<br>- LegalZoom Peace of Mind Review
<br>- 1-2-1 customer support
<br><br>In addition to the typical LLC formation services, LegalZoom provides legal services for its clients and accounting services for your business tax needs (e.g. payroll taxes). Their business services have a more a la carte approach, which can add up quickly.
<br><br>They don’t exactly have the best customer feedback due to customer support, but that’s usually the case with any company of this size and scope, so we have no problem recommending LegalZoom as an LLC service.

6. **[Rocket Lawyer]()**
<br>If you’re a small business owner interested in online legal services and advice beyond company formation, Rocket Lawyer is the best LLC service provider for you.
<br><br>Rocket Lawyer has a subscription-based model, which gives premium members access to additional legal help and advice; TRUiC worked with Rocket Lawyer to create an excellent deal for our users through the exclusive New Business Bundle, which offers premium membership services at a discounted price. For $349.99 + State Fees (Regularly $649.97 + State Fees), you’ll gain access to a plethora of features including:
<br>- LLC formation services
<br>- Registered agent service for 1 year
<br>- Online legal services such as:
<br> - Simple-to-use documents and contracts
<br> - Quick answers to your legal questions
<br> - Consultations with lawyers
<br> - More exclusive discounts

7. **[MyCompanyWorks](https://www.mycompanyworks.com/)**
<br>MyCompanyWorks (formerly My New Company) is an interesting option for people who want to use a smaller incorporation service, instead of a large, less personalized company perhaps like LegalZoom.
<br>- Startup Wizard To Help Organize After Formation
<br>- Next-Day Processing for Important Documents
<br>- Personalized Organizational Meeting Minutes & Corporate Bylaws
<br><br>Similar to ZenBusiness, MyCompanyWorks provides the same LLC formation services listed above (e.g. EIN and registered agent services).

8. **[BizFilings](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/)**
<br>BizFilings has been open for over 20 years forming different business structures, and remains a respected LLC service for businesses of all shapes and sizes. Some of their popular features include:
<br><br>- 3 Months of Free Registered Agent Service
<br>- BizComply Compliance Monitoring Tool
<br>- Extensive Document Library Access
<br><br>BizFilings also has lots of valuable free educational content on their website, including some informative FAQs and state-by-state guides. They don’t stand out in any one way, but their incorporation filing package is nicely balanced.
