## Startup Info Website

1. **[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/)**
<br>TechCrunch is the granddaddy of tech startup websites, where you learn about who raised what and which companies are taking off.
The company also hosts startup events with notable founders, venture capitalists, and they run hackathons.

2. **[ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)**
<br>Product Hunt is a newer website that relies on user upvotes and influencers to curate the top-trending cool new products made by developers.
Many successful startup companies start off as side projects. ProductHunt makes it easy to quickly see what innovations are happening in the tech world and which ones people like.

3. **[VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/)**
<br>Similar to TechCrunch, venture beat is a news source for startup, technology, and innovation. Personally, I prefer TechCrunch, but VentureBeat also offers some good educational articles and resources, like Whitepapers. You can view their startup section here.

4. **[Reddit Futurology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology)**
<br>I think that a lot of people wouldn’t list this as a place to find “tech startup news,” but I’m including it because quite often, the prototype or minimum viable product comes before the recognition that “this could be a successful startup.”

5. **[Mashable](https://mashable.com/)**
<br>Mashable has diversified a lot in the last few years in terms of the types of content it publishes. They still publish good information on technology, business and social media. However, the stories about genuine early stage startups (not Facebook, Evernote, or Uber) aren’t as frequent. I recommend checking out their startup section.

6. **[Inc](https://www.inc.com/)**
<br>I really like Inc magazine. Although their website has more education content than news content, it’s still a great source to learn about new and growing startups or interesting technology. You can also subscribe to their newsletter to recieve articles from specific sections like “grow” “startup” and “innovate.

7. **[Entrepreneur](https://www.entrepreneur.com/)**
<br>Personally, I don’t use Entrepreneur.com that much for startup news. I think the website is more focused on tips and bits of advice. However, they do occasionally write interesting news stories. I honestly like their physical magazine more, but I think it’s worth checking every now and again.

8. **[YCombinator’s Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)**
<br>YCombinator isn’t just a well-known seed stage fund. They also operate Hacker News, where users can submit news, interesting links, and programming “hacks.”

9. **[Tech.co](https://tech.co/)**
<br>Tech.co or Tech Cocktail covers technology, startup, and city-based news. The company is also well known for its events and startup mixers.

10. **[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/)**
<br>Forbes is an amazing resource for business and financial information. Although it’s not as strongly focused on tech startups as some of the other websites above, it does have an entrepreneurship and technology section that you can comb for info about new startups.

11. **[PandoDaily (now Pando)](https://www.pando.com/)**
<br>Finally, PandoDaily is another great website that covers tech startup news, primarily in Silicon Valley. Their PandoMonthly videos are some of my favorite youtube videos on entrepreneurship. They also offer a paid membership to receive premium content.
